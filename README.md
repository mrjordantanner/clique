### Inspiration & Design 
Let's face it-- people have many options when choosing a messaging app to use.  Clique seeks to build upon the traditional chat room app by adding a simple yet fun way for users and social spaces to be represented and interacted with.
Users have a 'token' or 'widget' that they can drag around the screen.  Chat channels can be joined by dragging the token into the channel socket, or users can just stay in General chat, which everyone is always connected to.

### User Stories
As a social person, I want to communicate with other people.
As a social person, I want to find and meet other people to chat with.
As a gamer, I want to be entertained.
As a user, I want to see and interact with other users in a simple yet unique and interesting way

### Feedback & Contributions

As mentioned, this app is far from complete and there is a lot of work to be done.  I welcome any feedback or contributions to the project, especially in regards to adhering to best practices, minimizing code redundancies, improving performance (especially network related), adding or improving features, and commenting and documentation.
